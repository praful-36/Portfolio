                  Many web development companies use freelance developers or interns for
                  their projects. Even some of the best website design companies donâ€™t give access for clients to meet with
                  their designers or developers. <br /> So, you have asked a very vital question and you
                  should ask this to any firm you approach for this purpose. With us, you will directly work with our core
                  developers but may change according to the stages of development.

                  A typical website will take 14 weeks at a minimum from start to
                  launch. This includes 3 weeks discovery, 6 weeks design, 3 weeks initial development, and 2 weeks of
                  modifications. It could take much longer if you wait until the end to start writing content.

                  YES! Everything that we build will be 100% owned by you. Most of our

                  reason you decide you want to take your site to another hosting service and get another company to
                  service the site, we will happily assist you in making the transition as effortlessly
                  and efficiently as possible.
